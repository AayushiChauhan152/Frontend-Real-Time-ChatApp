# Frontend Real Time Chat App

It is a real-time chat application utilizing WebSocket for communication. The backend is built with Spring Boot and MongoDB Atlas as the database, while the frontend is developed using React-Vite. Initially designed as a simple group chat app, I plan to enhance it with additional features over time.
